## Remixed 3D Model Attempt

Here you will find my attempt at combining Andy Warhol’s “Brillo Soap Pad Boxes” with images of an original yellow version of the Brillo box. The goal was to cover the open side, which was previously missing from the orginal 3D model, with images of the yellow Brillo Boxes superimposed on top in order to fill in the gap with a representaion of the commecial product the Warhol took inspiration from and reassert the commercial history of Brillo.
